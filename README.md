### General usage

### Authentication

Before using the GitHub Issues CLI, you will need to [create a personal access token](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/). This token can be passed to commands using the `-t|--token` option, or alternatively it can be saved in a `GITHUB_ISSUES_CLI_TOKEN` environment variable.
